Guard is used for providing a preview of the documentation. Run the following
commands to open a preview of the rendered documentation in a browser.
Unfortunately there's no live reload - just refresh the browser whenever you
save changes to `README.adoc`.

[source,bash]
----
bin/bundle install
bin/guard # <1>
open README.html # <2>
----
<1> This doesn't exit, so following commands have to be entered elsewhere
<2> Opens the preview in browser. Manually refresh browser as necessary
