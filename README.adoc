== Introduction
:link-shared-library: https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/

This is a {link-shared-library}[Shared Jenkins Library] that's automatically
imported into every Jenkinsfile. The automatic loading means that all the
<<global-variables>> described below are always available in every
Jenkinsfile.

== Global variables

=== `deployer`

`deployer` supports branch deploys.footnote:[Feature branches are deployed to and
validated in production before merging back to master.]

To migrate an existing project out from the current orchestrated release
flow and to adopt Continuous Deployment via branch deploys, follow these
steps:

. Upgrade the project's Jenkinsfile to:
.. Add a `issueCommentTrigger('!deploy')` build trigger
.. Wrap the arguments of `podTemplate`, <<code-inpod-code>>, or other with
`deployer.wrapPodTemplate`
.. Call `deployer.deployOnCommentTrigger` after the code has been tested and
a Docker image built
. Remove the project from all current release files footnote:[See e.g.
https://github.com/salemove/release/pull/769[release#769]. This ensures that
the production version isn't overwritten by a release currently in beta, for
example.]
. Add `continuous-integration/jenkins/pr-merge/deploy` as a required check in
GitHub

Each step is explained in detail below.

==== Adding a issue comment trigger

In a declarative pipeline, add a `triggers` section to the main `pipeline`
directive as follows.
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
  // ...
  triggers {
    issueCommentTrigger('!deploy')
  }
  // ...
}
----

In a scripted pipeline, include the following snippet at the top level.
[source,groovy]
----
properties([
  pipelineTriggers([issueCommentTrigger('!deploy')])
])
----

==== Wrapping the pod template

Here's an example.
[source,diff]
----
-inDockerAgent(containers: [imageScanner.container()]) {
+inDockerAgent(deployer.wrapPodTemplate(containers: [imageScanner.container()])) {
   // ...
 }
----

==== Enabling deploy on comment trigger
:link-using-libraries: https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#using-libraries

The exact changes required depend on the project, but here's an example.
[source,diff]
----
 // At the top level
+@Library('SaleMoveAcceptance') _ // <1>

 // In podTemplate, inPod, or similar, after building a docker image
 def image = docker.build('call-router')
 imageScanner.scan(image)
-def shortCommit = sh(returnStdout: true, script: 'git log -n 1 --pretty=format:"%h"').trim()
-docker.withRegistry(DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL, DOCKER_REGISTRY_CREDENTIALS_ID) {
-  image.push(shortCommit) // <2>
-}

+deployer.deployOnCommentTrigger(
+  image: image,
+  kubernetesDeployment: 'call-router',
+  kubernetesContainer: 'call-router',
+  inAcceptance: {
+    runAcceptanceTests(
+      driver: 'chrome',
+      visitorApp: 'v2',
+      suite: 'acceptance_test_pattern[lib/engagement/omnicall/**/*_{spec,tests}.rb]', // <3>
+      slackChannel: '#tm-engage,
+      parallelTestProcessors: 1
+    )
+  }
+)

-build(job: 'kubernetes-deploy', ...)
----
<1> This is needed for running acceptance tests before deploying to other
environments. If you already have a `@Library` import followed by a single
underscore, then change the underscore to two underscores (`__`) or more, as
required. The symbol {link-using-libraries}[has to be unique] within the Jenkinsfile.
<2> No need to push the image to anywhere. Just build it and pass to
`deployOnCommentTrigger`, which tags and pushes as required.
<3> The tests and the other checks run in acceptance obviously vary by project.

==== Disabling merges for non-deployed PRs
:link-call-router-settings: https://github.com/salemove/call-router/settings/branches/master

* Open the {link-call-router-settings}[master branch settings for the
project].footnote:[`call-router` settings are linked here as an example.
Click *Settings* -> *Branches* -> *Edit* `master` in GitHub to access.]
* Check *Require status checks to pass before merging*, if not already checked
* Check the `continuous-integration/jenkins/pr-merge/deploy` status
footnote:[The status only becomes available for selection if GitHub has seen
the status on at least one commit in the project. If it's not available, then
wait until at least one PR has been deployed.] footnote:[Ensure that
`continuous-integration/jenkins/pr-merge` and `review/squash` are also
checked.]


=== `inPod`
:link-pod-template: https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin#pod-and-container-template-configuration
:link-node: https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-durable-task-step/#code-node-code-allocate-node

`inPod` is a thin wrapper around the {link-pod-template}[Kubernetes plugin
`podTemplate`] + a nested {link-node}[`node`] call. Every setting that can
be provided to `podTemplate` can be provided to `inPod` and its
derivatives (described below).

It provides default values for fields such as `cloud` and `name`, so that
you don't need to worry about them. It makes creating a basic worker pod
very simple. For example, let's say you want to build something in NodeJS.
The following snippet is everything you need to achieve just that.

[source,groovy]
----
inPod(containers: [interactiveContainer(name: 'node', image: 'node:9-alpine')]) {
  checkout(scm)
  container('node') {
    sh('npm install && npm test')
  }
}
----

NOTE: `inPod` and its derivatives also include a workaround for an issue with
the Kubernetes plugin where the `label` has to be updated for changes to the
container or volume configurations to take effect. It's fixed by automatically
providing a unique suffix to the pod label using the hash of the provided
argument map.

IMPORTANT: When using `inPod` or its derivatives, it's best to also use
<<code-passivecontainer-code>>, <<code-interactivecontainer-code>>, and
<<code-agentcontainer-code>> instead of using `containerTemplate` directly.
This is because the `containerTemplate` wrappers provided by this library all
share the same `workingDir`, which makes them work nicely together.

=== `inDockerAgent`
:link-docker-build: https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/#building-containers

A pod template for building docker containers.

Unlike `inPod`, `inDockerAgent` has an agent container footnote:[A
container named `jnlp`, in which all commands will run by default, unless
the container is changed with `container`.] which supports building docker
images. So if you need to run {link-docker-build}[`docker.build`], use
`inDockerAgent` instead of `inPod`.

NOTE: `inDockerAgent` is a derivative of <<code-inpod-code>>, so everything
that applies to `inPod` also applies to `inDockerAgent`.

=== `inRubyBuildAgent`

A pod template for building Ruby projects. Comes with an agent container
with Ruby and Docker support and PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ containers.

NOTE: `inRubyBuildAgent` is a derivative of <<code-inpod-code>>, so everything
that applies to `inPod` also applies to `inRubyBuildAgent`.

=== `passiveContainer`

A {link-pod-template}[`containerTemplate`] wrapper for databases and other
services that will not have pipeline steps executed in them. `name` and
`image` fields are required.

Example:
[source,groovy]
----
inPod(
  containers: [
    passiveContainer(
      name: 'db',
      image: 'postgres:9.5-alpine',
      envVars: [
        envVar(key: 'POSTGRES_USER', value: 'myuser'),
        envVar(key: 'POSTGRES_PASSWORD', value: 'mypass')
      ]
    )
  ]
) {
  // Access the PostgreSQL DB over its default port 5432 at localhost
}
----

WARNING: Only specify the `workingDir`, `command`, `args`, and/or
`ttyEnabled` fields for `passiveContainer` if you know what you're doing.

=== `interactiveContainer`

A {link-pod-template}[`containerTemplate`] wrapper for containers that
will have pipeline steps executed in them. `name` and `image` fields are
required. Pipeline steps can be executed in the container by wrapping them
with `container`.

Example:
[source,groovy]
----
inPod(containers: [interactiveContainer(name: 'ruby', image: 'ruby:2.5-alpine')]) {
  checkout(scm)
  container('ruby') {
    sh('bundle install')
  }
}
----

WARNING: Only specify the `workingDir`, `command`, `args`, and/or
`ttyEnabled` fields for `interactiveContainer` if you know what you're
doing.

NOTE: `interactiveContainer` specifies `/bin/sh -c cat` as the entrypoint
for the image, so that the image doesn't exit. This allows you to run
arbitrary commands with `container` + `sh` within the container.

=== `agentContainer`

A {link-pod-template}[`containerTemplate`] wrapper for agent containers.
Only the `image` field is required. It replaces the default `jnlp`
container with the one provided as the `image`. The specified image has to
be a Jenkins slave agent.

Example:
[source,groovy]
----
inPod(containers: [agentContainer(image: 'salemove/jenkins-agent-ruby:2.4.1')]) {
  checkout(scm)
  sh('bundle install && rake') // <1>
  docker.build('my-ruby-project')
}
----
<1> Compared to the `interactiveContainer` example above, this doesn't
have to be wrapped in a `container`, because the agent itself supports
Ruby.

WARNING: Only specify the `name`, `workingDir`, `command`, `args`, and/or
`ttyEnabled` fields for `agentContainer` if you know what you're doing.

=== `withResultReporting`

A scripted pipeline footnote:[As opposed to declarative pipelines.]
wrapper that sends build status notifications to Slack.

Without specifying any arguments it sends Slack notifications to the #ci
channel whenever a master branch build status changes from success to failure
or back. To send notifications to your team's channel, specify the
`slackChannel` argument.
[source,groovy]
----
withResultReporting(slackChannel: '#tm-engage') {
  inPod {
    checkout(scm)
    // Build
  }
}
----

TIP: If the main branch in a project is different from `master`, then reporting
can be enabled for that branch by specifying `mainBranch`. E.g.
`withResultReporting(mainBranch: 'develop')`.

For non-branch builds, such as cronjobs or manually started jobs, the above
status reporting strategy does not make sense. In these cases a simpler
`onFailure` strategy can be used.
[source,groovy]
----
properties([
  pipelineTriggers([cron('30 10 * * 5')])
])

withResultReporting(slackChannel: '#tm-is', strategy: 'onFailure') {
  inPod {
    // Do something
  }
}

== Developing

Guard is used for providing a preview of the documentation. Run the following
commands to open a preview of the rendered documentation in a browser.
Unfortunately there's no live reload - just refresh the browser whenever you
save changes to `README.adoc`.

[source,bash]
----
bin/bundle install
bin/guard # <1>
open README.html # <2>
----
<1> This doesn't exit, so following commands have to be entered elsewhere
<2> Opens the preview in browser. Manually refresh browser as necessary
