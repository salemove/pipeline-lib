== Introduction
:link-shared-library: https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/

This is a {link-shared-library}[Shared Jenkins Library] that's automatically
imported into every Jenkinsfile. The automatic loading means that all the
<<global-variables>> described below are always available in every
Jenkinsfile.

== Global variables

=== `deployer`

`deployer` supports branch deploys.footnote:[Feature branches are deployed to and
validated in production before merging back to master.]

To migrate an existing project out from the current orchestrated release
flow and to adopt Continuous Deployment via branch deploys, follow these
steps:

. Upgrade the project's Jenkinsfile to:
.. Configure the job's properties
.. Wrap the arguments of `podTemplate`, <<code-inpod-code>>, or other with
`deployer.wrapPodTemplate`
.. Call `deployer.deployOnCommentTrigger` after the code has been tested and
a Docker image built
. Remove the project from all current release files footnote:[See e.g.
https://github.com/salemove/release/pull/769[release#769]. This ensures that
the production version isn't overwritten by a release currently in beta, for
example.]
. Add `continuous-integration/jenkins/pr-merge/deploy` as a required check in
GitHub

Each step is explained in detail below.

==== Configuring the job's properties

This adds a build trigger so that deploys can be started with `!deploy` PR
comments. It also configures the Datadog plugin, so that we can collect metrics
about deployments.

In a declarative pipeline, add a `properties` call before the `pipeline`
directive as follows.
[source,diff]
----
+properties(deployer.wrapProperties())
+
 pipeline {
   // ...
 }
----

In a scripted pipeline, include the same `properties` call:
[source,groovy]
----
properties(deployer.wrapProperties())
----

Or wrap an existing `properties` call with the provided wrapper:
[source,diff]
----
-properties([
+properties(deployer.wrapProperties([
   parameters([
     string(name: 'my-param', defaultValue: 'my-val', description: 'A description')
   ])
-])
+]))
----

==== Wrapping the pod template

Here's an example.
[source,diff]
----
-inDockerAgent(containers: [imageScanner.container()]) {
+inDockerAgent(deployer.wrapPodTemplate(containers: [imageScanner.container()])) {
   // ...
 }
----

==== Enabling deploy on comment trigger
:link-using-libraries: https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#using-libraries

The exact changes required depend on the project, but here's an example.
[source,diff]
----
 // At the top level
+@Library('SaleMoveAcceptance') _ // <1>

 // In podTemplate, inPod, or similar, after building a docker image
 def image = docker.build('call-router')
 imageScanner.scan(image)
-def shortCommit = sh(returnStdout: true, script: 'git log -n 1 --pretty=format:"%h"').trim()
-docker.withRegistry(DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL, DOCKER_REGISTRY_CREDENTIALS_ID) {
-  image.push(shortCommit) // <2>
-}

+deployer.deployOnCommentTrigger(
+  image: image,
+  kubernetesDeployment: 'call-router',
+  automaticChecksFor: { env ->
+    env['runInKube'](
+      image: '662491802882.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/smoke-test-repo:latest', // <3>
+      command: './run_smoke_tests.sh',
+      additionalArgs: '--env="FOO=bar" --port=12345' // <4>
+    )
+    if (env.name == 'acceptance') {
+      runAcceptanceTests(
+        driver: 'chrome',
+        visitorApp: 'v2',
+        suite: 'acceptance_test_pattern[lib/engagement/omnicall/.*_spec.rb]', // <5>
+        slackChannel: '#tm-engage,
+        parallelTestProcessors: 1
+      )
+    }
+  },
+  checklistFor: { env ->
+    def dashboardURL = "https://app.datadoghq.com/dash/206940?&tpl_var_KubernetesCluster=${env.name}" // <6>
+    def logURL = "https://logs.${env.domainName}/app/kibana#/discover?_g=" + // <7>
+      '(time:(from:now-30m,mode:quick,to:now))&_a=' +
+      '(query:(language:lucene,query:\'application:call_router+AND+level:error\'))'
+
+    [[
+      name: 'dashboard', // <8>
+      description: "<a href=\"${dashboardURL}\">The project dashboard (${dashboardURL})</a> looks OK" // <9>
+    ], [
+      name: 'logs',
+      description: "No new errors in <a href=\"${logURL}\">the project logs (${logURL})</a>"
+    ]]
+  }
+)

-build(job: 'kubernetes-deploy', ...)
----
<1> This is needed for running acceptance tests before deploying to other
environments. If you already have a `@Library` import followed by a single
underscore, then change the underscore to two underscores (`__`) or more, as
required. The symbol {link-using-libraries}[has to be unique] within the Jenkinsfile.
<2> No need to push the image to anywhere. Just build it and pass to
`deployOnCommentTrigger`, which tags and pushes as required.
<3> The image defaults to the current version of the application image.
<4> Additional arguments to `kubectl run`.
<5> The tests and the other checks run in acceptance obviously vary by project.
<6> Use `env.name` to customize links for the specific environment. It's one
of: `acceptance`, `beta`, `prod-us`, and `prod-eu`.
<7> Use `env.domainName` to customize URLs. For example, it's
`beta.salemove.com` in beta and `salemove.com` in prod US.
<8> This should be a simple keyword.
<9> Blue Ocean UI https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-41162[currently]
doesn't display links, while the old one does. This means that links have to
also be included in plain text, for Blue Ocean UI users to see/access them.

==== Disabling merges for non-deployed PRs
:link-call-router-settings: https://github.com/salemove/call-router/settings/branches/master

* Open the {link-call-router-settings}[master branch settings for the
project].footnote:[`call-router` settings are linked here as an example.
Click *Settings* -> *Branches* -> *Edit* `master` in GitHub to access.]
* Check *Require status checks to pass before merging*, if not already checked
* Check the `continuous-integration/jenkins/pr-merge/deploy` status
footnote:[The status only becomes available for selection if GitHub has seen
the status on at least one commit in the project. It should appear as soon as
you've opened a PR with the Jenkinsfile changes described above.]
footnote:[Ensure that `continuous-integration/jenkins/pr-merge` and
`review/squash` are also checked.]


=== `inPod`
:link-pod-template: https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin#pod-and-container-template-configuration
:link-node: https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-durable-task-step/#code-node-code-allocate-node

`inPod` is a thin wrapper around the {link-pod-template}[Kubernetes plugin
`podTemplate`] + a nested {link-node}[`node`] call. Every setting that can
be provided to `podTemplate` can be provided to `inPod` and its
derivatives (described below).

It provides default values for fields such as `cloud` and `name`, so that
you don't need to worry about them. It makes creating a basic worker pod
very simple. For example, let's say you want to build something in NodeJS.
The following snippet is everything you need to achieve just that.

[source,groovy]
----
inPod(containers: [interactiveContainer(name: 'node', image: 'node:9-alpine')]) {
  checkout(scm)
  container('node') {
    sh('npm install && npm test')
  }
}
----

NOTE: `inPod` and its derivatives also include a workaround for an issue with
the Kubernetes plugin where the `label` has to be updated for changes to the
container or volume configurations to take effect. It's fixed by automatically
providing a unique suffix to the pod label using the hash of the provided
argument map.

IMPORTANT: When using `inPod` or its derivatives, it's best to also use
<<code-passivecontainer-code>>, <<code-interactivecontainer-code>>, and
<<code-agentcontainer-code>> instead of using `containerTemplate` directly.
This is because the `containerTemplate` wrappers provided by this library all
share the same `workingDir`, which makes them work nicely together.

=== `inDockerAgent`
:link-docker-build: https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/#building-containers

A pod template for building docker containers.

Unlike `inPod`, `inDockerAgent` has an agent container footnote:[A
container named `jnlp`, in which all commands will run by default, unless
the container is changed with `container`.] which supports building docker
images. So if you need to run {link-docker-build}[`docker.build`], use
`inDockerAgent` instead of `inPod`.

NOTE: `inDockerAgent` is a derivative of <<code-inpod-code>>, so everything
that applies to `inPod` also applies to `inDockerAgent`.

=== `inRubyBuildAgent`

A pod template for building Ruby projects. Comes with an agent container
with Ruby and Docker support and PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ containers.

NOTE: `inRubyBuildAgent` is a derivative of <<code-inpod-code>>, so everything
that applies to `inPod` also applies to `inRubyBuildAgent`.

=== `passiveContainer`

A {link-pod-template}[`containerTemplate`] wrapper for databases and other
services that will not have pipeline steps executed in them. `name` and
`image` fields are required.

Example:
[source,groovy]
----
inPod(
  containers: [
    passiveContainer(
      name: 'db',
      image: 'postgres:9.5-alpine',
      envVars: [
        envVar(key: 'POSTGRES_USER', value: 'myuser'),
        envVar(key: 'POSTGRES_PASSWORD', value: 'mypass')
      ]
    )
  ]
) {
  // Access the PostgreSQL DB over its default port 5432 at localhost
}
----

WARNING: Only specify the `workingDir`, `command`, `args`, and/or
`ttyEnabled` fields for `passiveContainer` if you know what you're doing.

=== `interactiveContainer`

A {link-pod-template}[`containerTemplate`] wrapper for containers that
will have pipeline steps executed in them. `name` and `image` fields are
required. Pipeline steps can be executed in the container by wrapping them
with `container`.

Example:
[source,groovy]
----
inPod(containers: [interactiveContainer(name: 'ruby', image: 'ruby:2.5-alpine')]) {
  checkout(scm)
  container('ruby') {
    sh('bundle install')
  }
}
----

WARNING: Only specify the `workingDir`, `command`, `args`, and/or
`ttyEnabled` fields for `interactiveContainer` if you know what you're
doing.

NOTE: `interactiveContainer` specifies `/bin/sh -c cat` as the entrypoint
for the image, so that the image doesn't exit. This allows you to run
arbitrary commands with `container` + `sh` within the container.

=== `agentContainer`

A {link-pod-template}[`containerTemplate`] wrapper for agent containers.
Only the `image` field is required. It replaces the default `jnlp`
container with the one provided as the `image`. The specified image has to
be a Jenkins slave agent.

Example:
[source,groovy]
----
inPod(containers: [agentContainer(image: 'salemove/jenkins-agent-ruby:2.4.1')]) {
  checkout(scm)
  sh('bundle install && rake') // <1>
  docker.build('my-ruby-project')
}
----
<1> Compared to the `interactiveContainer` example above, this doesn't
have to be wrapped in a `container`, because the agent itself supports
Ruby.

WARNING: Only specify the `name`, `workingDir`, `command`, `args`, and/or
`ttyEnabled` fields for `agentContainer` if you know what you're doing.

=== `withResultReporting`

A scripted pipeline footnote:[As opposed to declarative pipelines.]
wrapper that sends build status notifications to Slack.

Without specifying any arguments it sends Slack notifications to the #ci
channel whenever a master branch build status changes from success to failure
or back. To send notifications to your team's channel, specify the
`slackChannel` argument.
[source,groovy]
----
withResultReporting(slackChannel: '#tm-engage') {
  inPod {
    checkout(scm)
    // Build
  }
}
----

TIP: If the main branch in a project is different from `master`, then reporting
can be enabled for that branch by specifying `mainBranch`. E.g.
`withResultReporting(mainBranch: 'develop')`.

For non-branch builds, such as cronjobs or manually started jobs, the above
status reporting strategy does not make sense. In these cases a simpler
`onFailure` or `always` strategy can be used.
[source,groovy]
----
properties([
  pipelineTriggers([cron('30 10 * * 5')])
])

withResultReporting(slackChannel: '#tm-is', strategy: 'onFailure') {
  inPod {
    // Do something
  }
}
----

By default `withResultReporting` only includes the build status
(success/failure), the job name, and links to the build in the slack message.
Additional project-specific information can be included via the `customMessage`
argument.
[source,groovy]
----
properties([
  parameters([
    string(name: 'buildParam', defaultValue: 'default', description: 'A parameter')
  ])
])

withResultReporting(customMessage: "Build was started with: ${params.buildParam}") {
  inPod {
    // Do something
  }
}
----

== Developing

Guard is used for providing a preview of the documentation. Run the following
commands to open a preview of the rendered documentation in a browser.
Unfortunately there's no live reload - just refresh the browser whenever you
save changes to `README.adoc`.

[source,bash]
----
bin/bundle install
bin/guard # <1>
open README.html # <2>
----
<1> This doesn't exit, so following commands have to be entered elsewhere
<2> Opens the preview in browser. Manually refresh browser as necessary
